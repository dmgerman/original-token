multiline_comment|/* Header file for Special Initializers for certain USB Mass Storage devices&n; *&n; * $Id: initializers.h,v 1.1 2000/08/29 23:07:02 mdharm Exp $&n; *&n; * Current development and maintenance by:&n; *   (c) 1999, 2000 Matthew Dharm (mdharm-usb@one-eyed-alien.net)&n; *&n; * This driver is based on the &squot;USB Mass Storage Class&squot; document. This&n; * describes in detail the protocol used to communicate with such&n; * devices.  Clearly, the designers had SCSI and ATAPI commands in&n; * mind when they created this document.  The commands are all very&n; * similar to commands in the SCSI-II and ATAPI specifications.&n; *&n; * It is important to note that in a number of cases this class&n; * exhibits class-specific exemptions from the USB specification.&n; * Notably the usage of NAK, STALL and ACK differs from the norm, in&n; * that they are used to communicate wait, failed and OK on commands.&n; *&n; * Also, for certain devices, the interrupt endpoint is used to convey&n; * status of a command.&n; *&n; * Please see http://www.one-eyed-alien.net/~mdharm/linux-usb for more&n; * information about this driver.&n; *&n; * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it&n; * under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the&n; * Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option) any&n; * later version.&n; *&n; * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but&n; * WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&n; * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
