multiline_comment|/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------&n; * Technical Specification reverse engineered with SniffUSB on Windows98&n; * =====================================================================&n; *&n; *  The technical details of the device have been acquired be using &quot;SniffUSB&quot;&n; *  and the vendor-supplied device driver (version 2.3A) under Windows98. To&n; *  identify the USB vendor-specific requests and to assign them to terminal &n; *  settings (flow control, baud rate, etc.) the program &quot;SerialSettings&quot; from&n; *  William G. Greathouse has been proven to be very useful. I also used the&n; *  Win98 &quot;HyperTerminal&quot; and &quot;usb-robot&quot; on Linux for testing. The results and &n; *  observations are summarized below:&n; *&n; *  The USB requests seem to be directly mapped to the registers of a 8250,&n; *  16450 or 16550 UART. The FreeBSD handbook (appendix F.4 &quot;Input/Output&n; *  devices&quot;) contains a comprehensive description of UARTs and its registers.&n; *  The bit descriptions are actually taken from there.&n; *&n; *&n; * Baud rate (divisor)&n; * -------------------&n; *&n; *   BmRequestType:  0x4 (0100 0000B)&n; *   bRequest:       0x5&n; *   wValue:         0x0&n; *   wIndex:         0x0&n; *   wLength:        0x4&n; *   Data:           divisor = 115200 / baud_rate&n; *&n; *&n; * Line Control Register (LCR)&n; * ---------------------------&n; *&n; *  BmRequestType:  0x4 (0100 0000B)    0xc (1100 0000B)&n; *  bRequest:       0x7                 0x6&n; *  wValue:         0x0&n; *  wIndex:         0x0&n; *  wLength:        0x1&n; *  Data:           LCR (see below)&n; *&n; *  Bit 7: Divisor Latch Access Bit (DLAB). When set, access to the data&n; *  &t;   transmit/receive register (THR/RBR) and the Interrupt Enable Register&n; *  &t;   (IER) is disabled. Any access to these ports is now redirected to the&n; *  &t;   Divisor Latch Registers. Setting this bit, loading the Divisor&n; *  &t;   Registers, and clearing DLAB should be done with interrupts disabled.&n; *  Bit 6: Set Break. When set to &quot;1&quot;, the transmitter begins to transmit&n; *  &t;   continuous Spacing until this bit is set to &quot;0&quot;. This overrides any&n; *  &t;   bits of characters that are being transmitted.&n; *  Bit 5: Stick Parity. When parity is enabled, setting this bit causes parity&n; *  &t;   to always be &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;, based on the value of Bit 4.&n; *  Bit 4: Even Parity Select (EPS). When parity is enabled and Bit 5 is &quot;0&quot;,&n; *  &t;   setting this bit causes even parity to be transmitted and expected.&n; *  &t;   Otherwise, odd parity is used.&n; *  Bit 3: Parity Enable (PEN). When set to &quot;1&quot;, a parity bit is inserted&n; *  &t;   between the last bit of the data and the Stop Bit. The UART will also&n; *  &t;   expect parity to be present in the received data.&n; *  Bit 2: Number of Stop Bits (STB). If set to &quot;1&quot; and using 5-bit data words,&n; *  &t;   1.5 Stop Bits are transmitted and expected in each data word. For&n; *  &t;   6, 7 and 8-bit data words, 2 Stop Bits are transmitted and expected.&n; *  &t;   When this bit is set to &quot;0&quot;, one Stop Bit is used on each data word.&n; *  Bit 1: Word Length Select Bit #1 (WLSB1)&n; *  Bit 0: Word Length Select Bit #0 (WLSB0)&n; *  &t;   Together these bits specify the number of bits in each data word.&n; *  &t;     1 0  Word Length&n; *  &t;     0 0  5 Data Bits&n; *  &t;     0 1  6 Data Bits&n; *  &t;     1 0  7 Data Bits&n; *  &t;     1 1  8 Data Bits&n; *&n; *  SniffUSB observations: Bit 7 seems not to be used. There seem to be two bugs&n; *  in the Win98 driver: the break does not work (bit 6 is not asserted) and the&n; *  sticky parity bit is not cleared when set once. The LCR can also be read&n; *  back with USB request 6 but this has never been observed with SniffUSB.&n; *&n; *&n; * Modem Control Register (MCR)&n; * ----------------------------&n; *&n; *  BmRequestType:  0x4  (0100 0000B)&n; *  bRequest:       0xa&n; *  wValue:         0x0&n; *  wIndex:         0x0&n; *  wLength:        0x1&n; *  Data:           MCR (Bit 4..7, see below)&n; *&n; *  Bit 7: Reserved, always 0.&n; *  Bit 6: Reserved, always 0.&n; *  Bit 5: Reserved, always 0.&n; *  Bit 4: Loop-Back Enable. When set to &quot;1&quot;, the UART transmitter and receiver&n; *  &t;   are internally connected together to allow diagnostic operations. In&n; *  &t;   addition, the UART modem control outputs are connected to the UART&n; *  &t;   modem control inputs. CTS is connected to RTS, DTR is connected to&n; *  &t;   DSR, OUT1 is connected to RI, and OUT 2 is connected to DCD.&n; *  Bit 3: OUT 2. An auxiliary output that the host processor may set high or&n; *  &t;   low. In the IBM PC serial adapter (and most clones), OUT 2 is used&n; *  &t;   to tri-state (disable) the interrupt signal from the&n; *  &t;   8250/16450/16550 UART.&n; *  Bit 2: OUT 1. An auxiliary output that the host processor may set high or&n; *  &t;   low. This output is not used on the IBM PC serial adapter.&n; *  Bit 1: Request to Send (RTS). When set to &quot;1&quot;, the output of the UART -RTS&n; *  &t;   line is Low (Active).&n; *  Bit 0: Data Terminal Ready (DTR). When set to &quot;1&quot;, the output of the UART&n; *  &t;   -DTR line is Low (Active).&n; *&n; *  SniffUSB observations: Bit 2 and 4 seem not to be used but bit 3 has been&n; *  seen _always_ set.&n; *&n; *&n; * Modem Status Register (MSR)&n; * ---------------------------&n; *&n; *  BmRequestType:  0xc  (1100 0000B)&n; *  bRequest:       0x2&n; *  wValue:         0x0&n; *  wIndex:         0x0&n; *  wLength:        0x1&n; *  Data:           MSR (see below)&n; *&n; *  Bit 7: Data Carrier Detect (CD). Reflects the state of the DCD line on the&n; *  &t;   UART.&n; *  Bit 6: Ring Indicator (RI). Reflects the state of the RI line on the UART.&n; *  Bit 5: Data Set Ready (DSR). Reflects the state of the DSR line on the UART.&n; *  Bit 4: Clear To Send (CTS). Reflects the state of the CTS line on the UART.&n; *  Bit 3: Delta Data Carrier Detect (DDCD). Set to &quot;1&quot; if the -DCD line has&n; *  &t;   changed state one more more times since the last time the MSR was&n; *  &t;   read by the host.&n; *  Bit 2: Trailing Edge Ring Indicator (TERI). Set to &quot;1&quot; if the -RI line has&n; *  &t;   had a low to high transition since the last time the MSR was read by&n; *  &t;   the host.&n; *  Bit 1: Delta Data Set Ready (DDSR). Set to &quot;1&quot; if the -DSR line has changed&n; *  &t;   state one more more times since the last time the MSR was read by the&n; *  &t;   host.&n; *  Bit 0: Delta Clear To Send (DCTS). Set to &quot;1&quot; if the -CTS line has changed&n; *  &t;   state one more times since the last time the MSR was read by the&n; *  &t;   host.&n; *&n; *  SniffUSB observations: the MSR is also returned as first byte on the&n; *  interrupt-in endpoint 0x83 to signal changes of modem status lines. The USB&n; *  request to read MSR cannot be applied during normal device operation.&n; *&n; *&n; * Line Status Register (LSR)&n; * --------------------------&n; *&n; *  Bit 7   Error in Receiver FIFO. On the 8250/16450 UART, this bit is zero.&n; *  &t;    This bit is set to &quot;1&quot; when any of the bytes in the FIFO have one or&n; *  &t;    more of the following error conditions: PE, FE, or BI.&n; *  Bit 6   Transmitter Empty (TEMT). When set to &quot;1&quot;, there are no words&n; *  &t;    remaining in the transmit FIFO or the transmit shift register. The&n; *  &t;    transmitter is completely idle.&n; *  Bit 5   Transmitter Holding Register Empty (THRE). When set to &quot;1&quot;, the FIFO&n; *  &t;    (or holding register) now has room for at least one additional word&n; *  &t;    to transmit. The transmitter may still be transmitting when this bit&n; *  &t;    is set to &quot;1&quot;.&n; *  Bit 4   Break Interrupt (BI). The receiver has detected a Break signal.&n; *  Bit 3   Framing Error (FE). A Start Bit was detected but the Stop Bit did not&n; *  &t;    appear at the expected time. The received word is probably garbled.&n; *  Bit 2   Parity Error (PE). The parity bit was incorrect for the word received.&n; *  Bit 1   Overrun Error (OE). A new word was received and there was no room in&n; *  &t;    the receive buffer. The newly-arrived word in the shift register is&n; *  &t;    discarded. On 8250/16450 UARTs, the word in the holding register is&n; *  &t;    discarded and the newly- arrived word is put in the holding register.&n; *  Bit 0   Data Ready (DR). One or more words are in the receive FIFO that the&n; *  &t;    host may read. A word must be completely received and moved from the&n; *  &t;    shift register into the FIFO (or holding register for 8250/16450&n; *  &t;    designs) before this bit is set.&n; *&n; *  SniffUSB observations: the LSR is returned as second byte on the interrupt-in&n; *  endpoint 0x83 to signal error conditions. Such errors have been seen with&n; *  minicom/zmodem transfers (CRC errors).&n; *&n; *&n; * Flow control&n; * ------------&n; *&n; *  SniffUSB observations: no flow control specific requests have been realized&n; *  apart from DTR/RTS settings.
